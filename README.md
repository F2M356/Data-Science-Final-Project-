# Rain and Temperature Relation and Prediction Using Machine Learning in Bangladesh

The aim of this research is to find relation and predict temperature and rainfall in Bangladesh using Bangladesh Weather Dataset. To find out which ML/ANN models performs better predictions.

## Project Objectives:
1. Analyze the relationship between rain and temperature.
2. Assess and compare the performance of SVR, MLR, and ANN in predicting rain and temperature.
3. Weigh up the efficiency of different machine learning techniques in particularly handling weather data.
4. Figure out the most appropriate model for rain and temperature prediction based on performance metrics.

The dataset is a combination of the temperature and rainfall data, aligned by date to facilitate joint analysis. The dataset is structured into a CSV file with the following columns: 
1. Temp: Average temperature for the month.
2. Month: The month for the data point, ranging from 1 (January) to 12 (December).
3. Year: The year of the data point.
4. Rain: Total rainfall for the month.
5. Temporal Coverage: Earliest Date: 1901 and Latest Date: 2023
